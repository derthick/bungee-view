<b>Bungee View</b> is a visualization prototype developed at Carnegie Mellon University to support casual users gaining an understanding of an image collection as a whole, and in finding patterns in such collections. As a research experiment with the University of Pittsburgh, you can explore many of the <a href="http://images.library.pitt.edu/pghphotos/">Historic Pittsburgh image collections</a> hosted by the University Library System's <a href="http://digital.library.pitt.edu/">Digital Research Library</a>. 

<p>
Since this novel way of exploring image collections is a research project, your usage will be recorded to help improve Bungee View. We will use your IP address to track your repeat visits, but will not attempt to identify you as a person. We also welcome feedback to <script type="text/javascript">

<h2>Data-Mining with Bungee View</h2>

<img src="HPchildren3.jpg">
<br>

<b>Bungee View</b> lets you <b><i>search, browse, and data-mine</i></b> image collections.  It shows an overview of the entire collection, in addition to the familiar result list and item details of other search interfaces.  

<h3>Bar charts provide collection overviews</h3>

<p>
For each metadata category, vertical bars show the distribution of images in the collection that match your query.  In the screenshot above, the query is for images that show Children.  The bottom row of bars shows the resulting distribution for various man-made (Built) Environments.  Wide bars represent Environments that appear in many images in the collection.  Tall bars represent Environments a large fraction of which appear in images that match the query.  For instance, 53% of images that show Sports & Recreation Facilities also show Children, while only 2% of those that show Commercial Facilities do.
</p>

<p>
In data-mining terms, there is a positive association between Children and  Sports & Recreation Facilities, while there is a negative association between Children and Commercial Facilities.
</p>

<p>
To understand the 3D effect, imagine the bars are draped over a very long table like a tablecloth.  The perspective foreshortening provides a non-linear scale so that you can see differences in bar lengths both for Environments that frequently appear with Children (53% of Sports & Recreation Facilities vs. 40% of Gardens) as well as for those that rarely do (2.3% of Commercial Facilities vs. 2.1% of Transportation Facilities).
</p>

<p>
The tablecloth is positioned so that the average bar height (9%) just reaches the table edge.  Any bar that extends onto the table top represents a positive association with the query, and vice versa.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

Web search engines have attracted widespread demand for information retrieval from unstructured documents. The number of structured and semi-structured documents available on the Web is also huge, and collections of these are more amenable to data mining. Yet there has been no similar explosion of interest in this kind of exploration. Finding patterns in databases of political contributions, environmental data, or hospital and school performance would surely interest many citizens. The main research question for this project is how to support such exploration for users with little or no training in statistics or programming. In contrast to other data-mining systems, Bungee View focuses on learnability, responsiveness,  robustness, and providing a satisfying user experience.

<p>
<b>Bungee View</b> lets you <b><i>search, browse, and data-mine</i></b> an image collection.  
<ul>
<li>
It shows an overview of the entire collection, in addition to the familiar result list and item details of other search interfaces.  
<li>Click on any underlined text, or on any image or colored bar.  
<li>For more information, use the Help menu.
</ul>
</p>

<img src="AsiaQuery.jpg">

<h3>Bar charts provide collection overviews</h3>

<p>
For each metadata category, vertical bars show the distribution of images in the collection that match your query.  The query above is for images that show places in Asia.  The bottom row of bars show matches for Kinds of People.  Wide bars represent Kinds of People that appear in many images in the collection.  Tall bars represent Kinds of People a large fraction of which appear in images that match the query.  For instance, 38% of images that show Educators & Communicators also show Places in Asia, while only 1% of those that show Manual Laborers do.
</p>

<p>
In data-mining terms, there is a positive association between Asia and Communicators & Educators, while there is a negative association between Asia and Manual Laborers.
</p>

<p>
To understand the 3D effect, imagine the bars are draped over a very long table like a tablecloth.  The perspective forshortening provides a non-linear scale so that you can see differences in bar lengths both for Kinds of People that frequently appear with Asian images (38% of Communicators & Educators vs. 29% of Health & Safety -associated people) as well as for those that rarely do (2% of Children vs. 1% of Manual Laborers).
</p>

<p>
The tablecloth is positioned so that the average bar height (7%) just reaches the table edge.  Any bar that extends onto the table top represents a positive association with the query, and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>Research Goals</h3>

<p>
Bungee View is a research prototype designed to explore the feasibility of supporting casual users gaining an understanding of an image collection as a whole, and in <a href="Goals.html">finding patterns in such collections</a>.  Your usage will be recorded to help us improve Bungee View.  We will use your IP address to track your repeat visits, but will not attempt to identify you as a person.  We also welcome feedback via email at the address below.

<h1>Bungee View Tips and Tricks</h1>

<dl>
<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;">Notice the <b>Mouse Documentation Line</b> at the bottom of the window</span>
<dd>
As you move the mouse, it tells you what will happen if you click (on the left) and/or more details about the category value (on the right).  That way you can see the name and count for a value without opening its category.
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;">How to determine <b>what filters are in effect</b></span>
<dd>
There is an English-like description of your current query just under the "Search" label.  If it doesn't fit on one line, you can click on it and see the full description.  Each filter term is also highlighted in bright green, both along the left edge of the Search column, as well as when they appear in the Selected Result column.  Since the selected result satisfies all the filters, they will all appear there (unless you are using OR to combine multiple values for a category).
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Navigate in the Selected Result column</b></span>
<dd>
You can add and remove filters by clicking on category values for the selected result just like you can on the bars and labels in the Search column.  Since you can see all the categories and values at once, this is faster for the common case where the selected result has the values you are interested in.
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Navigate with the arrow keys</b></span>
<dd>
After you click on a thumbnail in the Results column, you can use the arrow keys to select adjacent thumbnails.  After you click on a bar or label in the Search column, you can use the right and left arrow keys to select adjacent category values.  This is especially useful when there are too many values to fit on the screen.
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Filter on multiple values</b> for a category</span>
<dd>
Use control-click to add (or remove) additional single values, or shift-click to add a range of values to a filter on a category.  The filter will match items that have AT LEAST ONE of the selected values for that category.  Clicking on the checkbox in front of a label has the same effect as control-clicking.
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Control how your browser shows help pages and result details</b></span>
<dd>
Bungee View tells your default browser what web page to display, but the browser decides whether to replace the current page, open a new window, or open a new tab.  Some browsers let you customize this behavior.  For instance, in Firefox go to Tools>Options>Tabs.
<br>
<br>

<dt>
<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Layout Customization</b></span>
<dd>
The initial text size is set to match that of the browser that launched Bungee View.  You can change it interactively by dragging the header border up and down.  Move the mouse over the border until you see a horizontal white line, and then drag the line.  You can also adjust the widths of the Search, Results, and Selected Result columns by dragging their borders.  (If you resize the whole window, it will compute new column widths and lose your changes.)  To change the number of columns of thumbnails, move the mouse over them until you see a white grid, and then drag the grid.

<h2>Why is Bungee View so slow?</h2>

<h3>Startup</h3>
<p>
You have to load a 270K Java applet, and then about 10K of data before you see anything on the screen.  This takes at least 40 seconds on a 56K dial-up connection.  (Your browser will cache the Java code, so it won't take so long in the future.)

<p>

For some reason, it can take much longer than this if you are running Google Desktop.  Try 
quitting it, or "pause indexing."

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
Each new search requires several database queries, which should take less than half a second in total.  You also have to load up to about 6K of data about category counts.  This is in addition to thumbnails and an image.  

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>
Animations should all last one second, and they should not be jerky on recent computers (at least 1GHz and 512MB).

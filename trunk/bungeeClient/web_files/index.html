<p><b>Bungee View</b> is designed to support non-technical
users in gaining an understanding of an image collection as a whole, and in
finding patterns in their meta-data, while they search and browse. Since this
is a research project, your usage will be recorded to help improve Bungee View.
We will use your IP address to track your repeat visits, but will not attempt
to identify you as a person. We also welcome feedback to <script  type="text/javascript">

<h2><a name=mining>Data-Mining with Bungee View</a></h2>

<p><img src=AsiaQuery2.jpg><br>
<b>Bungee View</b> lets you <b><i>search, browse, and data-mine</i></b> image
collections. It shows an overview of the entire collection, in addition to the
familiar result list and item details of other search interfaces. </p>

<h3>Bar charts provide collection overviews</h3>

<p>For each metadata category, vertical bars show the distribution of images in
the collection that match your query. In the screenshot above, the query is for
images that show Places in Asia. The bottom
row of bars shows the resulting distribution for various Kinds of People. Wide
bars represent Kinds of People that appear in many images in the collection.
Tall bars represent Kinds of People a large fraction of which appear in images
that match the query. For instance, 38% of images that show
Educators &amp; Communicators also show Places in Asia,
while only 1% of those that show Manual Laborers do. The curve
superimposed on the percent labels shows the non-linear scale. It distorts the
bar heights so that the average value (8% for Kinds of People) is half as high
as 100%. The blue-gray background indicates this average value. </p>

<p>In data-mining terms, there is a positive association between Asia and
Communicators &amp; Educators, while there is a negative association between Asia and Manual Laborers. Any bar that extends above the
blue-gray background represents a positive association, and vice versa. The bar
color indicates whether the association is statistically significant. Gray bars
stand for values that are not significantly associated with the query. Muted
green bars are positive significant associations (at a significance level of
one in ten thousand, using a Chi Squared Test, or for small expected values a
Fisher Exact Test). Orange bars are negative significant associations. Both the
Communicators &amp; Educators association and the Manual Laborers association
are significant. Saturated green and red bars (such as Asia)
are for values that are part of the query. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Web search engines have attracted widespread demand for
information retrieval from unstructured documents. The number of structured and
semi-structured documents available on the Web is also huge, and collections of
these are more amenable to data mining. Yet there has been no similar explosion
of interest in this kind of exploration. Finding patterns in databases of
political contributions, environmental data, or hospital and school performance
would surely interest many citizens. The main research question for this
project is how to support such exploration for users with little or no training
in statistics or programming. In contrast to other data-mining systems, Bungee
View focuses on learnability, responsiveness,
robustness, and providing a satisfying user experience. </p>

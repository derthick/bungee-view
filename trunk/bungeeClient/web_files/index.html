<p><b>Bungee View</b> is designed to support non-technical
users in gaining an understanding of an image collection as a whole, and in
finding patterns in their meta-data, while they search and browse. Since this
is a research project, your usage will be recorded to help improve Bungee View.

<h2><a name=mining>Data-Mining with Bungee View</a></h2>

<p><img src=AsiaQuery3.jpg><br>
<b>Bungee View</b> lets you <b><i>search, browse, and data-mine</i></b> image
collections. It shows an overview of the entire collection, in addition to the
familiar result list and item details of other search interfaces. </p>

<h3>Bar charts provide collection overviews</h3>

<p>For each metadata category, vertical bars show tags associated with your query. In the screenshot above, the query is for
images that show Places in Asia. The bottom
row of bars shows tags for the category Kinds of People. Wide
bars represent Kinds of People that appear in many images in the collection.
Tall bars represent Kinds of People associated with your query, either positively if the bar goes up, or negatively if the bar goes down. For instance, images that show Educators &amp; Communicators are six times as likely to show Places in Asia as images that show other Kinds of People, while those that show Manual Laborers are only one tenth as likely. The vertical scale ranges from 1/100th to 100 times the likelihood of other tags in the category, and is non-linear.

<p> The bar
color indicates whether the association is statistically significant. Dull green bars show significant positive associations. Dull red bars show significant negative associations. Gray bars show associations that are not significant. Both the
Communicators &amp; Educators association and the Manual Laborers association
are significant. Saturated green and red bars (such as Asia)
are for values that are part of the query. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Web search engines have attracted widespread demand for
information retrieval from unstructured documents. The number of structured and
semi-structured documents available on the Web is also huge, and collections of
these are more amenable to data mining. Yet there has been no similar explosion
of interest in this kind of exploration. Finding patterns in databases of
political contributions, environmental data, or hospital and school performance
would surely interest many citizens. The main research question for this
project is how to support such exploration for users with little or no training
in statistics or programming. In contrast to other data-mining systems, Bungee
View focuses on learnability, responsiveness,
robustness, and providing a satisfying user experience. </p>

A user searching for American Memory Collection images of World War II would click on that bar to add a filter. When filters are added, bars highlight correlated features. Especially tall or short bars represent large positive or negative correlation values. Those colored dull green or orange are statistically significant. </p> <p> Some of the correlations reflect obvious relationships about the world, like the over-representation of Politics & Government, and of Industry. Some are more intriguing, like Gliders. There are only 43 gliders out of 1712 images, so you might not notice them in a result list. Since the correlation is very high, it shows up in the bar chart. </p> <p> Verifying lack of correlation can be useful, for instance to check if the selected images represent a broad range of dates or collections. These images cover the years 1942-1945 evenly, and primarily come from four collections. </p> <p> It is surprising to see that Asia is under-represented in World War II images. This must a bias in the holdings or assignment of Subject terms, rather than a reflection of the world. It is also surprising that Men are under-represented, while Women are over-represented. Perhaps this is also an artifact of the collection, or maybe images of women better reflected the values Americans wanted to believe in, and the bias is a kind of propaganda. This is wild speculation, but a fortuitous green bar potentially signals a valuable discovery. </p> <p> This video focused on pattern discovery rather than the document retrieval casual users will likely begin with. As they gain experience, they may become curious and start to notice correlations. They may begin to see the forest in a collection, not just the trees. </p> <hr> <div style="text-align: right;"> http://cityscape.inf.cs.cmu.edu/bungee/Transcript.html <br> <em> Last update: 10 October 2014 </em> <br> <address> <a href="//www.cs.cmu.edu/~mad">Mark Derthick</a> <img id="email-infox" width="60" height="29" src="Images/email-8-color.gif" alt=""><script type="text/javascript">
